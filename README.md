# Burgers!

This application uses a simple font end design created using CSS and HTML with the help of Handlebars. The app is a good demonstration of a full stack application at work. The user can create their own buger by adding it through the UI. The burger is then added to the MySQL Database on the backend. The burger then becomes available to the user under the 'Burger Menu.' If the user clicks the devoured buttone associated to the burger they have created, the burger's enrty in MySQL is updated and will no be displayed in the 'Devoured' column.
